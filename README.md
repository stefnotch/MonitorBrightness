# MonitorBrightness

Head over to the releases https://github.com/stefnotch/MonitorBrightness/releases

It's a CLI program, look at the code https://github.com/stefnotch/MonitorBrightness/blob/main/Program.cs

Note that this one sadly doesn't come with a pretty UI or anything like that. I do hope the [lovely folks over at PowerToys will eventually get around to building something neat](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/1052).
